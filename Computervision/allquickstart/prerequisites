Prerequisites:
    - Install the Computer Vision SDK:
      pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
    - Create folder and collect images: 
      Create a folder called "resources" in your root folder.
      Go to this website to download images:
        https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-sample-data-files/tree/master/ComputerVision/Images
      Add the following 7 images (or use your own) to your "resources" folder: 
        faces.jpg, gray-shirt-logo.jpg, handwritten_text.jpg, landmark.jpg, 
        objects.jpg, printed_text.jpg and type-image.jpg

Run the entire file to demonstrate the following examples:
    - Describe Image

    - Batch Read File (recognize both handwritten and printed text)
